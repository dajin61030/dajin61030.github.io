Hello, my name is Dajin Kim, and I am a first-year student at the College of Software Convergence. I have a strong interest in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, and I am eager to learn how software can be applied to solve real-world problems.
As a freshman, I am excited to build a solid foundation in programming, data science, and software engineering. I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing ideas, and challenging myself with new projects. My goal is to grow into a versatile developer who can contribute to innovative solutions in the rapidly evolving digital world.
Outside of academics, I am curious about emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, and I look forward to gaining hands-on experience through both coursework and extracurricular activities.
